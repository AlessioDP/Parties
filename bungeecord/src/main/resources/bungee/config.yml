additional:
  # [Auto command system]
  # All party-mates will use the same command executed by the leader (Rank permission: party.autocommand)
  # You can configure the leader or any other rank with rank permissions
  #
  # With regex-whitelist you can choose which command should be replicated by other party-mates
  # You need to use REGEX (google it)
  # The default example will allows any command except /party, /pay and /money
  #
  # This will work only for BUNGEECORD commands. For Bukkit commands, setup auto-command in Bukkit Parties too!
  auto-command:
    enable: false
    regex-whitelist: '^(\/server|\/anothercommand).*'

  # [Exp system]

      # [Fixed mode]
      # Make a complete list of finite party levels

      #
      # repeat-last-one =>  Should the last one end the number of levels?
      #                     If on true, the number of levels will be infinite
      #                     Otherwise the party will reach that level as maximum
