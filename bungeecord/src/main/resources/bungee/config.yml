  #
  # With regex-whitelist you can choose which command should be replicated by other party-mates
  # You need to use REGEX (google it)
  # The default example will allows any command except /party, /pay and /money
  #
  # This will work only for BUNGEECORD commands. For Bukkit commands, setup auto-command in Bukkit Parties too!
